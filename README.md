## Example Automations

### Peak Period Alert
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Peak Rate Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.xcel_energy_colorado_tou_period
        to: "Peak"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Peak Rates Active"
          message: "Electricity is now at peak pricing"
```

### Smart Device Control
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Run Pool Pump Off-Peak"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.xcel_energy_colorado_tou_period
        to: "Off-Peak"
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: switch.pool_pump
```

## Data Sources

The integration attempts to download and parse official Xcel Energy tariff PDFs. When successful, it extracts:
- Base energy rates
- Time-of-use rates and schedules
- Fixed monthly charges
- Additional charges and riders
- Season definitions
- Effective dates

If PDF parsing fails, sensible fallback rates are used with clear indication.
