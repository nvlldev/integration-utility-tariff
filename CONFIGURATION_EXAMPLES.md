## Energy Dashboard Integration

### Cost Tracking Configuration
```yaml
# In Home Assistant Energy Dashboard settings
grid_consumption:
  - entity: sensor.smart_meter_consumption
    cost_entity: sensor.utility_tariff_current_rate_with_fees

grid_production:
  - entity: sensor.solar_production
    compensation_entity: sensor.utility_tariff_current_rate
```

### Custom Statistics
```yaml
# Track costs by TOU period
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Peak Period Cost Today"
        state: >
          {% set peak_kwh = state_attr('sensor.daily_consumption', 'peak_kwh')|float(0) %}
          {% set peak_rate = state_attr('sensor.utility_tariff_peak_rate', 'rate')|float(0) %}
          {{ (peak_kwh * peak_rate) | round(2) }}
        unit_of_measurement: "$"
        
      - name: "Off-Peak Savings Today"
        state: >
          {% set off_peak_kwh = state_attr('sensor.daily_consumption', 'off_peak_kwh')|float(0) %}
          {% set peak_rate = states('sensor.utility_tariff_peak_rate')|float(0) %}
          {% set off_peak_rate = states('sensor.utility_tariff_off_peak_rate')|float(0) %}
          {{ (off_peak_kwh * (peak_rate - off_peak_rate)) | round(2) }}
        unit_of_measurement: "$"
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Rate Not Updating
```yaml
# Force more frequent updates
update_frequency: hourly  # Instead of daily

# Or use service call
service: utility_tariff.refresh_rates
target:
  entity_id: sensor.utility_tariff_current_rate
```

### Wrong TOU Period
```yaml
# Override timezone if needed
time_zone: "America/Denver"

# Custom holiday calendar
holidays:
  - "2024-01-01"  # New Year
  - "2024-07-04"  # Independence Day
  - "2024-12-25"  # Christmas
```

### Solar Export Not Tracked
```yaml
# Ensure correct entity
return_entity: sensor.solar_meter_export  # Not production!

# Check entity state class
# The export entity should have state_class: total_increasing
```

## Best Practices

1. **Update Frequency**
   - Daily: For stable rates without TOU
   - Hourly: For TOU plans
   - Every 5 minutes: For real-time pricing (when available)

2. **Entity Selection**
   - Use entities with `state_class: total_increasing` for consumption
   - Ensure units are in kWh (not Wh or MWh)
   - For solar, use grid export, not total production

3. **Cost Projections**
   - Set realistic average daily usage
   - Update seasonally for accuracy
   - Account for seasonal rate changes

4. **Performance**
   - Limit update frequency to what's needed
   - Disable unused sensors in options
   - Use recorder exclusions for frequently updating sensors

## Provider-Specific Notes

### Xcel Energy
- PDF updates typically occur monthly
- TOU periods are consistent across states
- Summer months: June-September
- Peak hours: 3-7 PM weekdays

### Pacific Gas & Electric (Future)
- Different TOU schedules by plan
- Baseline allowances vary by climate zone
- Medical baseline available
- EV rates have super off-peak periods

### Real-Time Pricing (Future)
- Updates every 5-15 minutes
- Prices can be negative
- Requires different automation strategies
- Best for flexible loads
